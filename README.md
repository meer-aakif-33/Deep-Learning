ML vs DL

⦁	DL has high data and h/w dependency
⦁	DL takes more training time
⦁	Representation learning is a method of training a machine learning model to discover and learn the most useful representations of input data automatically.
⦁	interpretibilty is high in ML

Types of neurons:
1) Multi-layer perceptron : in supervised ML, to capture non linear relationships
2) Convolution Layer Network : Image and Video processing
3) RNN Recurrent Neural Network : feedback is also present, we can go in backward direction as well e.g., LSTM
4) Auto Encoders : input data is compressed without loosing the quality
5) Generative Adverserial Networks : generator, discriminator


Peceptron:

is an Algorithm, used for supervised machine learning
it is mathematical model, and or function
